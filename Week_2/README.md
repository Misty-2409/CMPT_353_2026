# Week 2: Introduction to HTML and Node.js

This week introduces the basics of HTML and how it connects with a Node.js server using Express.

## The goal is to help students understand:

- How to run a simple Node.js server using JavaScript outside the browser
- How an Express server handles HTTP requests and responses
- How server-side state is maintained using JavaScript variables
- The difference between HTML pages and JSON data served by a server
- How static HTML pages connect to server routes using hyperlinks
