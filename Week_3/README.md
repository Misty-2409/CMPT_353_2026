# Week 3: Practice DOM, Fetch API, Body Parser and File system


## The goal is to help students understand:

- Use the DOM to access and update HTML elements using JavaScript
- Use the Fetch API to send data from the browser to a Node.js server
- Understand how the server reads incoming data using body parsing middleware
- Use Node.js File System (fs) to store client data persistently on the server
