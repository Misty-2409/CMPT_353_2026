/***without docker***/
create your node file  (see previous lab examples)
type your code (server.js)
run it and check the names.txt file on your project or folder

/***with docker***/
Step 1: run your docker in vs code as it is (see previous lab examples)
Step 2: heck the names.txt file on your project or folder (no update right!! Go to Step 3)
        "Docker containers have isolated filesystems; files written inside a container do not appear on the host unless we explicitly connect them"
Step 3: change 
Step 4: open a new terminal and type the following commands
              docker exec -it container_name bash
              cat file.txt
      but this is not the file and also it does not have the same content as your computer fil.txt
      Again 
        "Docker containers have isolated filesystems; files written inside a container do not appear on the host unless we explicitly connect them"
        "Docker does NOT share files with your computer unless you tell it to"
Step 5: create a folder name data and create a file named names_new.txt inside the data folder
Step 6: Add this to your dockerfile
        COPY data ./data  
Step 7: Add this to you docker-compose.yml
        volumes:
         ./data:/app/data
Step 8: Force all image or contaienr built for this current code (server.js or your current cotainer name)
        docker compose down --rmi all
Step 9: open the bash for your container 
        docker exec -it node_week_3 bash
Step 10: open the name file on data directory
        cd data
        cata names_new.txt
